## Simple Calculator

A small, simple toy calculator made using Bison and Flex.

To build the calculator (without downloading Bison or Flex):

make run
./calc
```

**GNU C or Microsoft Visual Studio C is required, however.**

To build the rules too:

```shell
make
```

**GNU C, Bison, and Flex are all required.**
